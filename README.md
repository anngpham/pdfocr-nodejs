# PDF to Text Converter for LLM Applications

A REST API service that converts PDF documents (including those with images) into LLM-ready text format. This service helps prepare your PDF data for Large Language Model applications by extracting text from both standard PDFs and those containing images.

[![Docker Hub](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/anngpham/pdf-ocr)](https://hub.docker.com/r/anngpham/pdf-ocr)

## Features

-   Convert PDF documents to clean, structured text
-   Extract text from images within PDFs
-   Two processing methods:
    -   Basic OCR using OCRmyPDF for standard text extraction
    -   Advanced processing with OpenAI Vision API for enhanced accuracy
-   Selective page processing
-   Docker containerization

### üìë PDF Processing Methods

#### 1. Basic OCR Processing

`POST /ocr`

Uses OCRmyPDF to convert PDF documents (including images) to searchable text. This method is ideal for standard PDFs with clear text and simple images.

| Parameter   | Type     | Location  | Description                          |
| ----------- | -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `pdf`       | `file`   | form-data | PDF document to process              |
| `pageStart` | `number` | query     | Starting page (optional, default: 1) |
| `pageEnd`   | `number` | query     | Ending page (optional, default: 5)   |

```bash
# Basic OCR
curl -X POST \
  -F "pdf=@/path/to/file.pdf" \
  http://localhost:5500/ocr
```

**Sample Response:**

```json
{
	"status": "success",
	"msg": "File uploaded and processed successfully",
	"file": {
		"originalName": "book.pdf",

#### 2. AI-Powered Processing

`POST /ocr-ai`

Uses OpenAI Vision API for advanced text extraction and image analysis. This method provides better accuracy for complex documents and can understand context from images.

| Parameter    | Type     | Location  | Description                          |
| ------------ | -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `pdf`        | `file`   | form-data | PDF document to process              |
| `openAPIKey` | `string` | form-data | Your OpenAI API key                  |
| `pageStart`  | `number` | query     | Starting page (optional, default: 1) |
| `pageEnd`    | `number` | query     | Ending page (optional, default: 5)   |

```bash
# OCR with AI analysis
curl -X POST \
  -F "pdf=@/path/to/file.pdf" \
  -F "openAPIKey=your-api-key" \
  http://localhost:5500/ocr-ai
```
